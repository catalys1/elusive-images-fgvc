        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
        While the community has seen many advances in recent years to address the challenging problem
        of Finegrained Visual Categorization (FGVC), progress seems to be slowing&mdash;new
        state-of-the-art methods often distinguish themselves by improving top-1 accuracy by mere
        tenths of a percent. However, across all of the now-standard FGVC datasets, there remain
        sizeable portions of the test data that none of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models can
        successfully predict. This paper provides a framework for identifying and studying the errors
        that current methods make across diverse fine-grained datasets. Three models of
        difficulty&mdash;<b>Prediction Overlap</b>, <b>Prediction Rank</b> and <b>Pairwise Class Confusion</b>&mdash;are
        employed to highlight the most challenging sets of images and classes. Extensive experiments
        apply a range of standard and SOTA methods, evaluating them on multiple FGVC domains and
        datasets. Insights acquired from coupling these difficulty paradigms with the careful
        analysis of experimental results suggest crucial areas for future FGVC research, focusing
        critically on the set of elusive images that none of the current models can correctly classify.
